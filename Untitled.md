Category Theory as a New Metaphysics
==


There is no merit to telling the story about things in general. What is intriguing is not the specifics, the actions that can happen in the world, but rather the different ways of classifying abstract entities. What is a monad? What are actions that can happen to it?

The most cutting-edge thing you can study is what you know that no one else does. Everything else has been built up to ridiculously high levels of complexity. So let's start with this: what's a monoid?

Or better this: what's a thing that you don't care about? This is an object fascinating because its identity is the least important quality.

Perhaps the idea of induction is the best. As an undergrad, I took a math class and used mathematical induction to demonstrate function equality, starting with the base case. "Never start with what you're trying to prove" said the professor. That makes a lot of sense.

So instead let's focus on the ways we can get around this. Derrida-style, we can't reason our way to things without knowing what they stand for. In other words, how can I talk about 1,2,3 etc if I'm unable to talk about numbers, and how can I talk about numbers if I don't have numerals?

A good way around this problem is to set up another representation. Just as the numbers 1,2,3 etc can be used to name dogs or cats or bushels of wheat, morphisms can be used to classify operations on objects without getting down the the specific actions.

Let's say we're doing classification work. We abstract from individual items by naming them, so rather than classifying the actual items, we classify *how many* of them there are.

This is critical jump, because we no longer care about things anymore. If I have 3 of x, take 2 away, and then add 2 more, I have 3 of x. Different items probably, but still 'x's. The goal of these kinds of algebraic programs is to stop caring about "how" these things are in the world, but rather the operations that the underlying structure permits.

Think of this like an "interface" in OOP. A Java class inheriting "Comparable" can be sorted by the mere knowledge that items may be compared. The fact that it's a SortedList doesn't matter, any structure can be sorted if the underlying items support sorting.

### The movement from objects to numbers, the move from operations to morphisms. (Level 3 heading)

Let the objects sit in space, outside our reach or control. They have certain ways of interacting with each other. For instance, there's an idea of semi-permanance so they're not floating around popping in and out of existence. Secondly, they're identifiable in some way more than cardinality. If these objects were able to be transposed without detection, then we automatically lose a certain set of morphisms over the class.

So let the items be there. What is the barest modicum of presuppositions? That we can actually discriminate empty space from object-occupied foreground and that we have a rough correspondence with time (if I forget a 10-minute interval of object manipulation, it's unlikely structural operations will make sense to me).

#### For the epistemologists (Level 4 heading)
There are a number of questions we might have about how "outside" reality links with our perception of reality, but we'll leave these concerns to Immanuel Kant and navÃ¯vely take your word for it; if you see n-number of objects, that's how it is.

This gets down to a very fuzzy line between "something" and "nothing". After all, what can we say about something that isn't there?

We can call it the "null set" or make it an identity object, but this question of what separates the existence vs. non-existence of things will be revisited at a future point.

*Starting point*

I wanted this line about epistemology to be a brief sidestep to get back to the main point about pre-conditions. But right here, in this paragraph, I have no good way of doing so.

I can start a new subsection at the same level as this section, and I can go a level deeper. Let's try that.

#### This is the same level (Level 4 Heading)
Hello from epistemologists side-step!

##### This is a level down (Level 5 Heading)
Hi!

I'm now two levels removed from where I wanted to be, and there's still no way to get back to the conversational chain I had beforehand. I'll break out of this by creating a new Level 3 heading.

This all serves a point. The idea that a process or paragraph block can "hand off" control to another process or paragraph and potentially never recover their context is an extremely important one.

### Definitions

A category consists of objects and morphisms that link objects to other objects. This can be viewed as a [directed graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph) but doesn't have to be. In fact, viewing categories as directed graphs can become limiting when abstractions come into play.

Again, a category consists of objects and morphisms. A morphism from a -> b entails some kind of connection, but again, it may be more helpful to view this as a kind of logical implication rather than an edge connecting two vertices.

There may be a number of objects and a number of morphisms (also called "arrows") that link them. Think of a kind of network, with objects linked to each other like beads sewn into a tapestry.
